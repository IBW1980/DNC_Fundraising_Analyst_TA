SELECT count(contribution_id) as total_donation 
, count (distinct donor_id) as unique_donor
, sum (gift_amount) as revenue
, gift_date

FROM `famous-mix-318405.dnc_assessment.campaign_metadata` 

3. What was the conversion rate for new monthly recurring gifts from the same
email? The conversion rate is defined as the percentage of new gifts from the

SELECT EXTRACT(month FROM gift_date) as gift_month
, (Cast (((select sum(gift_amount) 
from `famous-mix-318405.dnc_assessment.processor_metadata`
where recurring_period in ('monthly')
and recurring_sequence in ('1') ) 
/ sum(cast(gift_amount as int)) *100) as string) + "%") as conversion_rate

FROM `famous-mix-318405.dnc_assessment.processor_metadata` 
GROUP BY gift_month

, count(proc.line_item_id) as gift_recuring
FROM `famous-mix-318405.dnc_assessment.processor_metadata` as proc
JOIN `famous-mix-318405.dnc_assessment.campaign_metadata` as camp
ON proc.ref_code_variant = camp.variant_name
